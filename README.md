# Node.js server with basic online chatting and username system.

**Ignore the LICENSE file, I don't know or care what it does, but as long as it protects people from directly using my code and publishing it as their own.**

_Assuming you have Node.JS installed beforehand on your computer, you should be able to run the program if you download and extract the zip._

A pet project that I started after my friend and I were messing around with AI generated code and it generated a Node.js server, 
so I built on upon that and made this chat.  I will be releasing another similar version of this, but much simplier, so if anyone 
just wants to see the code to make it work it will be avaliable.
